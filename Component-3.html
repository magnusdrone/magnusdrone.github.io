                        <p>We forecast that the workforce demand over a five-year period to produce and market the drone would be intensive. Right now, there is a growing demand in the prosumer market and our drone would theoretically provide more lift than a regular propeller-driven drone. Production should be easy to implement because the aeronautic design we used does not deviate much from what outs in the market as of right now. This would most certainly make the prosumer drone market more competitive by having two different types of drones out there that both function well and provide different benefits. </p>

                        <p>The program gives you the broad education necessary to understand and to impact global, economic, environmental, and society through robotics engineering solutions. The course is an undergraduate course that mainly focuses on the basics of robotics and its implementation into society. This relates to our NCT Technical Application because it’s about robotics and we are building one.</p>

                        <p>Located in Phoenix, North Dakota, the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences is one of the first universities to offer Unmanned Aircraft System <p>Operations as a Major. Centering on aviation applications, the Undergraduate Program in Unmanned Aircraft Systems aims to educate students in the operations, procedures, and regulations of the American National Airspace System. By working in team and directly applying various science and engineering principles, the program aims for the students to develop an understanding of the aviation industry and help to contribute to it effectively.</p>

                        <p>Title: Physics Principals in Robotics</p>
                        <p>Instead of limiting the course material to resolving around the magnus effect, this program would take a broader approach. This primarily project-based program would focus on having students apply physics principles in the field of robotics. An example of a project would be our own magnus effect drone. The goal of the program is for students to try experimenting with different designs for robots and to consider the different opportunities offered by utilizing these different principles. Another example would be entirely wind-powered robots. Part of the program would resolve around coding and another part would focus on construction and team management. Hopefully, this program could inspire some experimentation and contribution in the field of robotics.</p>
