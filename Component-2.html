One of which, that being the DYS D800 X4, has a similar design and rotary placement, although ours are cylindrical rotors. The technology they are using for flight and movement are also very similar.The second company we have identified is FanWing technologies. The products they specialize in is making planes using the Magnus effect as a propulsion system. We will be using the Magnus effect in a similar way, that being achieving flight, but in the form of a quadcopter. </p>

                        <p>We have identified the Company HorizonHobby for being a possible manufacturer of our product. They have in the past build many quadcopters and the also sell pieces individually. This makes them a good Company candidate because they would have the materials readily available if they so need to manufacture one of our drones. This is the email we sent them, we never heard back from them:</p>
                        <p>websales@horizonhobby.com</p>
                        <p>Hello,</p>
                        <p>We are working on a school project in which we designed and built a quadcopter drone that utilizes the Magnus effect in order to achieve lift. We researched about the products you manufacture and see that many of your projects overlap what we are doing. Could you evaluate and see the product out team has proposed? Here’s a description of the product:</p>
                        <p>Our product is a drone that uses four motors to rotate cylinders where propellers would have normally been. The quadcopter in of itself is not that big being only 18 cm long in both length and width. It flies remotely using a dual signal input from Bluetooth and radio.</p>
                        <p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>
